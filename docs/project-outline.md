# Digital Receipt Organizer — Project Outline

## 1. Project Overview
The Digital Receipt Organizer is a web application that allows users to upload, store, categorize, and analyze receipts. Users will be able to upload receipt images or PDFs, enter metadata such as vendor and amount, and view their receipts in a searchable, filterable interface. A dashboard will visualize spending trends. Future versions will include OCR to automatically extract receipt information.

## 2. Goals
- Build a functional receipt management system
- Allow users to upload receipt images/PDFs
- Store receipt metadata in a database
- Display receipts in a searchable, filterable table
- Provide visual spending analytics (category breakdown, monthly totals)
- Design the system so OCR can be added later without major redesign

## 3. Technologies Used
- Python (Flask)
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- SQLite (development)
- Chart.js (visualizations)
- Future: Tesseract OCR or EasyOCR

## 4. System Components
- Receipt Upload Module
- Receipt Storage & Database Layer
- Receipt List & Search Interface
- Dashboard & Analytics
- OCR Extraction Module (future milestone)
